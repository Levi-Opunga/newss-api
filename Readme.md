# <span style="color:Green">News-Api</span>

This is an api built using the spark framework.It is able to post,retrieve,update, and delete records from a Postgres
database.It is able to retrieve new articles on the basis of GENERAL news or DEPARTMENTAL news.The api uses exceptions
to enforce the one-to-many relationship between the articles and department.It also does the same for Staff and
Department.This prevents entry of non-corresponding values into tables throwing the corresponding relevant exception
messages as retrieve data to help resolve errors.

### <span style="color:red">Note:</span>

#### For easy testing of endpoints it is much easier to use the h2 persistent database because to delete and reset database completely delete the 'newss-Api.db' file in the home directory.

#### Uncomment the following the h2 line and comment the postgres one.

To use the postgres database run the create.sql script in the `src/main/resources/sql` folder in the project directory
or run the following:

````
CREATE DATABASE washington_post;
\c washington_post;
CREATE TABLE staff(
  ID  SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR,
  email VARCHAR,
  phone VARCHAR,
  Rank VARCHAR,
  staffRoles VARCHAR,
  dept_id int,
department VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE departments(
 id serial PRIMARY KEY,
 name VARCHAR,
 description VARCHAR
);

CREATE TABLE articles(
 id serial PRIMARY KEY,
 title VARCHAR,
 message VARCHAR,
 dept_id int,
 department VARCHAR
);
````

## <span style="color:Green"> Prerequisites</span>

- Knowledge of On Git CLI
- Java 11
- Gradle as a built tool
- IntelliJ or any Java based IDE
- postgres SQL sever installed
- Postman desktop client installed

## <span style="color:Green">Technologies</span>

- Java 11
- Gradle
- Spark
- JUnit
- Postgres Sql

## <span style="color:Green">Installation</span>

1. Clone or download repository as an archive
2. If archive unzip the archive to get project folder
3. Open the application's root folder in an IDE that can execute builds in java using gradle e.g. IntelliJ or Eclipse.
4. Navigate to the App.java file and run the `main` class
5. Use the link below to access the labeled request collection in Postman web,fork the collection into your personal workspace.
- "https://www.postman.com/dark-rocket-354200/workspace/team-workspace/collection/20876568-ce40f82f-3c9a-492d-a71e-119eed23c031?action=share&creator=20876568" 
6. For testing use Postman desktop client to access the forked collection because their cloud client does not access
   local ports like `localhost:4567` or `0.0.0.0:4567`.
7. In postman replace where indicated `:id` the number with the id you want to use in the path variables
8. Make sure you recreate the database in your local psql by running the psql commands above, or you have switched to
   the h2 database
9. If you do not fork the already created postman collection make sure to enter and label yours correctly to avoid errors because of extra spaces or missing characters 
10. You can use the samples in the `sample jsons` folder to make testing faster
